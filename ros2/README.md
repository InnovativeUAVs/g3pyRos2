Collect metrics from ROS2, using ROS2 subscriptions.

MSFS provides many [SimVars](https://docs.flightsimulator.com/html/index.htm?#t=Programming_Tools%2FSimVars%2FSimulation_Variables.htm)
which are mapped to G3 gauges via the mapping defined in `mapping.yml`.
SimVars units should be discovered automatically and tranformed to
match your specified gauge units.


You can test your mapping by starting up your publishers and running.

```sh
python -m ros2.fetch
```

You should see a dump of the currently mapped metrics:

ROS2CONNECT_EXCEPTION_UNRECOGNIZED_ID: in (b'ENG N1 RPM:1', b'Rpm (0 to 16384 = 0 to 100%)')
ROS2CONNECT_EXCEPTION_UNRECOGNIZED_ID: in (b'ENG MANIFOLD PRESSURE:1', b'inHG.')
