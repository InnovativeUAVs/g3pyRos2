# Maps xplane datarefs to G3 gauge metrics
# For each metric, specify the g3 metric name (or list of names),
# the dref location in xplane (see https://developer.x-plane.com/datarefs/)
# and optionally the xplane unit (supported by https://github.com/convert-units/convert-units)
# which will allow G3 to convert to the appropriate unit for display
# Finally, an optional fx lets you transform the input value to the metric.

# Interally, xplane connect (https://github.com/nasa/XPlaneConnect/)
# fetches drefs as tuples, which are then matched to the metric name(s) provided.
# e.g. to map multiple fuel quantities to the fuel_quantity dref, use a list as below

# Transformations via fx are applied to each element of the dref in turn, before mapping
# to metrics.  Provide a python expression where x is the input value.  You can also refer
# to any mapped dref as data['sim/time/zulu_time_sec'][0] - note the dictionary is
# indexed by dref name, and returns a tuple of values, even if only length 1.
