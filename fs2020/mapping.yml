# Maps FS2020 SimVars to gauges.  Metric units are auto-discovered,
# or can be overridden by specifying a `unit` for the metric.
# Raw simvar values can be transformed by specifying
# a python expression as 'fx', where the raw value is passed as a variable `x`
# See README.me for more details.
metrics:
  - metric: altitude
    simvar: PLANE_ALTITUDE
